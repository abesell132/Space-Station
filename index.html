Fifty-five percent of U.S. rivers are unsuitable for aquatic life, largely under threat from runoff contaminated by
fertilizersEPA 2013). Twenty-one percent of the United States' river and stream
  length are in good biological condition, down from 27 percent in 2004, according to the survey, carried out in 2008
  and 2009 at almost 2,000 sites. Twenty-three percent are in fair condition. Of the twenty-one percent that are in
  good condition, the Yellow Dog River is considered excellent water quality. The most important thing in an
ecosystem is the purity of its lifeblood, the water. Our organization monitors rivers, wetlands, springs, and lakes. We
contribute to several statewide and national programs, such as: the <a href="http://www.micorps.net/lakeoverview.html">MiCorps
  Cooperative Lakes Monitoring Program</a>, the <a href="http://www.micorps.net/streamoverview.html">MiCorps Volunteer
  Stream Monitoring Program</a> and the <a href="http://dev.sparkworksmarketing.com/yellowdog/programs/yellow-dog-riverkeeper/">Yellow
  Dog RIVERKEEPER®</a>. Our staff, volunteers, and consultants are trained to comply with program standards and follow
procedures for quality assurance and quality control. If you are interested in learning more about water pollution and
